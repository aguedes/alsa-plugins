AVTP Audio Format (AAF) Plugin
==============================

Overview
--------

The AAF plugin is a PCM plugin that uses Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP)
to transmit/receive audio samples through a Time-Sensitive Network (TSN)
capable network. The plugin enables media applications to easily implement AVTP
Talker and Listener functionalities.

Plugin Dependencies
-------------------

The AAF plugin uses libavtp to handle AVTP packetization. Libavtp source code
can be found in https://github.com/AVnu/libavtp as well as instructions to
build and install it.

The plugin also depends on some kernel API headers such as linux/if_ether.h so
make sure you have them installed in your system.

If libavtp or the kernel headers aren't detected by configure, the plugin isn't
built.

Plugin Configuration
--------------------

The plugin parameters are passed via ALSA configuration file. They are defined
as follows:

	* ifname: Network interface used to transmit/receive AVTP packets.

	* addr: Stream destination MAC address.

	* prio: Priority used by the plugin to transmit AVTP traffic. This
	  option is relevant only when operating in playback mode.

	* streamid: Stream ID associated with the AAF stream transmitted or
	  received by the plugin.

	* mtt: Maximum Transit Time (in microseconds) as defined in AVTP spec
	  section 4.3.3. This option is relevant only when operating in
	  playback mode.

	* time_uncertainty: Maximum Time Uncertainty (in microseconds) as
	  defined by AVTP spec section 4.3.3. This option is relevant only when
	  operating in playback mode.

	* frames_per_pdu: Number of audio frames transmitted in one AVTPDU.
